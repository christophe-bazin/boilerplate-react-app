# Project Coding Guidelines

- All comments must be in English and provide useful context (e.g. component/service purpose, non-trivial logic).
- Avoid noisy or redundant comments. Only add comments when they clarify intent or usage.
- Use file-level doc comments for components, hooks, or services to explain their role.
- Use TODO or FIXME for actionable reminders.
- Keep code clean and concise.
- Sensitive data (API keys, secrets) must never be committed.
- Use i18n for all user-facing text.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Commit early and often, with clear and concise messages (avoid overly long commit descriptions).
